# About the Book 
If you have been interested in machine learning but were unsure where to begin, this book is the perfect resource. It focuses on deep learning, a specialized area within machine learning, explaining fundamental concepts and providing the essential foundation to start building your own models. Rather than merely providing recipes for using existing toolkits, "Practical Deep Learning" elucidates the underlying principles of deep learning, encouraging further exploration.

A basic understanding of computer programming and high school-level math is all that is neededâ€”the book covers the rest. After an introduction to Python, key topics are addressed, such as constructing a quality training dataset, utilizing the scikit-learn and Keras libraries, and assessing the performance of your models.
# Chapter 8: INTRODUCTION TO NEURAL NETWORKS
A thorough examination of what will be referred to as traditional neural networks is conducted. However, prior to this, an introduction to the structure of a neural network is provided, followed by a brief example.
# Chapter 9: TRAINING A NEURAL NETWORK
In this chapter, the process of training a neural network will be explored. The standard methods and techniques currently used in the field will be examined. Although some mathematical concepts and new terms will be introduced, a deep understanding of the math is not required. The main points will be emphasized, and detailed explanations will be simplified as necessary to ensure clarity.
